Just a simple README file. I am hungry but I am also losing weight. So I might as well drink some more water. 
Here is an update, I am still thinking about food. It has been a week on the IF diet and while I certainly have seen weight loss, I have not broken through the hunger thing yet. By the way, this udpate was just a minute from the initial note, so perhaps I should give it some more time.
